## Decision Guide

**Use basic-usage.yml if:**
- You're just getting started
- You want simple, out-of-the-box validation
- You have a single-language project

**Use advanced-config.yml if:**
- You need strict validation that can fail PRs
- You want to use the more powerful Gemini 1.5 Pro model
- You need custom size limits or comment identifiers

**Use multi-language.yml if:**
- Your project has multiple programming languages
- You have different guidelines for different types of changes
- You want language-specific validation rules

## Integration Patterns

### With Branch Protection
Add the validation job as a required status check:
```yaml
# In your branch protection rules
required_status_checks:
  - "AI Validation"
```

### Conditional Execution
Only validate external contributions:
```yaml
if: github.event.pull_request.head.repo.fork == true
```

### Multiple Validators
Run different validators for different scenarios:
```yaml
comment-identifier: 'security-validator'  # For security reviews
comment-identifier: 'docs-validator'      # For documentation
```
